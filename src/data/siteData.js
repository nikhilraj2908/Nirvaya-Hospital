  {
    question: "Do I need an appointment before visiting Nirvaya Eyecare Centre?",
    answer: "Prior slot pre-booking is recommended to minimize waiting times and ensure Dr Sandhya Gaur can give you dedicated, unhurried time. However, sudden emergencies (like sudden loss of vision, eye trauma, or acute retinal tears) are attended to promptly."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a comprehensive dilated retina evaluation take?",
    answer: "A complete retina checkup requires pupil dilation using specialized eye drops, which takes approximately 30 to 45 minutes to achieve adequate dilation. The examination, retinal imaging and counselling take another 20 to 30 minutes. We advise having a companion to drive you home as vision remains blurred for 2–4 hours after dilation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is cataract surgery performed on a day-care basis?",
    answer: "Yes. Modern micro-incision phacoemulsification takes only 10 to 15 minutes in the operating room. You will arrive 1 hour prior to surgery for preparation and can comfortably return home within 1 to 2 hours post-procedure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is an Intravitreal Injection and is it painful?",
    answer: "Intravitreal injections deliver targeted anti-VEGF medication directly into the vitreous gel for conditions like macular degeneration or diabetic edema. The eye is thoroughly numbed with topical anesthetic drops; patients feel slight mild pressure, but the procedure is quick and virtually painless."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents should I bring for my first consultation?",
    answer: "Please bring all previous eye prescription glasses, prior ophthalmology reports, medical history summaries (particularly diabetes, hypertension, blood thinners), and any recent retinal scans if available."
  }
